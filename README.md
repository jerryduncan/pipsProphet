# PipsProphet -- Predicting price action with Deep Learning

The forex and synthetic indices market has witnessed huge changes in prices from high, low, low-high and high-low due to fundamental and technical analysis which intends to determine the actual state of price at each point in time-frame, this has led many financial experts in the market to look beyond the market to proffer financial advice to traders across the world.

Alot will ague that the use of INDICATORS such as [Fibonacci Retracement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_retracement), [Moving Average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average), [Stochastic Oscillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_oscillator), [Relative Strength Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_strength_index), [Bollinger Bands](https://origin2.cdn.componentsource.com/sites/default/files/resources/dundas/538216/Documentation/Bollinger.html) and alot more which basically are built on mathematical functions are better suit in understanding price, another set of financial experts prefer to study price chart over a long period of time using the Higher TimeFrmae HTF and Lower TimeFrame LTF index which they call PRICE ACTION.

This algorithm intends to merge both the indicators and price action understanding with deep learning algorithms to understudy price and help forecast price over a short and long period of time.
